    Controls - 'WASD', 'Q', and 'E'.

    This is a little maze game where you must find your way to the center to see a special surprize.
    <p>
    I added support to add mazes to this game easily. One only needs to make 32x32 picture (and a little more code to make it selectedable).
    <p>
    The 32x32 png only needs to contain pixels with max transparency (a wall in the maze off random height between 1 and 4),
    <p>
    and any other pixel (dirt road). The creator only needs to remember the fixed location of the player and the 'surprise in the center'.
    <p>
    Right now, I have only added 2 maps to the pool. You can tell which map is selected by the image at the bottom of the screen.
    <p>
    If the mouse controls for the camera are too finiky, you can use WASD along with QE to move and control the camera respectfully.
    <p>
    Story: You hear noises coming from the heart of your maze garden. Noises from a creature you've never heard before. What could it be? 
    <p>
    Could it be friendly... or dangerous? You know of only one way to find out.
